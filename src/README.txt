Full address column
===================

This add-on adds two new columns called "Sender (@)" and "Recipient (@)" in 
message list containing full, raw addresses of sender and recipient instead 
of just names like in default columns.

This add-on is reimplementation of "Show address only" which stopped working 
in Thunderbird 78. This add-on source is based on "SFreq" by Jorg K.
